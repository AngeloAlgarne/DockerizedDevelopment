# ./dockerfiles

## Dockerfiles
These are dockerfile templates for your project. The extra folders serve as extra files needed.

To use the dockerfile template, you can do:
- Copy-paste the appropriate contents to a new Dockerfile; 

Or IF you dont need dependenices such as requirements.txt or package.json, then you can also:
- Directly set the path of a docker compose to the path of the template.

## Compose
For the compose file, copy the service needed in the compose.db.template.yml and paste in the main compose.yml file.

If you need to save the data, scroll down to the bottom and apply the same approach.
